# React Prime Calculator

This project is a code sample application that is a client for my [Express.js Prime Calculator](https://github.com/tiitustelke/prime-calculator)

## Nice things about this React.js App

- Integration tests using Jest and React test libraries
- Input sanitation
- Not unnecessarily complicated, simple and clear code

## How to run this app

1. First set up the Prime Calculator Express.js server following the README instructions there. Make sure you have installed Node.js.
2. Clone this repository with the command `git clone git@https://github.com/tiitustelke/react-prime-calculator.git`.
3. Change into the root directory of the cloned project `cd path/to/project/folder`.
4. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`
5. After the server is running, run the command `npm start` to launch this React app. This runs the app on http://localhost:3000.
